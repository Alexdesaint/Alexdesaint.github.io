# Projects overview

## Wiring harness viewer for Augmented Reality glasses
##### Apprenticeship at Safran 

{{< column/1 >}}

<!--
As an apprentice I had to assess the Hololens 2 for industrial use in the plane cabling process. 
Part of this assessment was to visualise wiring harness on augmented reality glasses to guide technicians in the harness construction. Factories are operating with paper schematics and use it as data carrier between design offices and factories so my starting point was a paper diagram.
-->
As an apprentice I had to assess the *Hololens 2* glasses to improve the industrial use in the plane cabling process.
These augmented reality glasses could at terme be used in the wiring harness manufacture: instead of wiring on printed schematics plans, techian could directly visualising the schematics in the glasses. 



{{< column/2 >}}
<!--
I extracted coordinate information from the schematics and made a dynamic shematics generator with Unity3D that runs on augmented reality glasses.
-->
In order to read the schematics sent by the design offices, I had to create a software able to translate 2D vectorial drawings into 3D space.
This led to new features like path finding in the wire network or decomposing the plan into several layers.

## Designing and setting up omnidirectional safety laser
##### Internship at LAMOR on a logistic robot

My mission was to upgrade an existing logistic robot with safety sensors:

> "Alexandre visited our laboratory during his international internship in Croatia. Immediately, he has shown great enthusiasm for the projects that we were conducting at the time. Specifically, he was involved in designing and setting up an omnidirectional safety laser system for a mobile robot intended to carry pallets. He was independent and showed impressive knowledge, especially in the area of embedded engineering. At the end of his internship the system was operational and ensured safe stopping of robot. All that, while at the same he had to tackle a university semester in a foreign country."

## Open source graphics engine

##### [Alexdesaint/BlobEngine](https://github.com/Alexdesaint/BlobEngine)

In 2018 I started this project for learning purposes. I put in practice the 3D kinematics and C++ programming learned in robotics classes.
With C++, CMAKE and *OpenGL 4.5* I am coding this engine with simplicity in mind and with minimal dependancy :

- [Dav1dde/glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) to load *OpenGL*
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) to create the Window and handle inputs
- [ocornut/imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) to create graphical interfaces
- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) to load GLTF json files
- [nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) to load image for texturing

My objective is to one day use this project in a professional application and to continue the developpement with the Vulkan API.
