  - All Options is a derivatives trading company specialised in trading options. I am part of the technology department dedicated to develop new technologies and ensure the continuity of the trading platform.
  - My first large project was to rewrite a C++ trading strategy that place options orders in pre-open phase on Euronex and was not able to handle the amount of order-books updates. The application is required to manage order-book, send orders and cancel orders with a single thread asynchronously.
  - Wrote a portfolio management application that automatically move delta-neutral and vega-neutral positions when we trade. Used to create the company's spread or dispersion strategies.
  - Worked on processing market data for fitting the volatility to the market using the **Vola Dynamics** library. Used on EURO STOXX 50 and other liquid European indices.
  - Created a new real-time pricing application entirely based on **Vola Dynamics**, used on all traded products in the US. Since June 2023, I am leading a team of four developers aiming to expand to all products in Europe and US with a real-time and historical pricing and replace all the previous pricing applications.
