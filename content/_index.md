skills:
- tag: Low latency
  text:
  - Experienced in designing applications with low latency and high reliability requirements. I have a methodic approach and always abstract problems into a model (state machine, Grafcet, block diagram...). Competent with asynchronous programming, parallel computing and networking.
  - Proficient with **C++ 17**, **CMAKE**, **Boost**, the **LLVM** ecosystem and now moving to **C++ 23**. Using **Linux** as my working environnement, I am complementing non low latency with **Python**, **Go** or **Javascript** for math, server or webapp.
  - I had **VHDL** as part of my university teaching and learned **OpenGL** and **BGFX** on my free time. Would be interested in working with GPU-accelerated computing or **FPGA**.
